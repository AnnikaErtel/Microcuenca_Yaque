#AIM
First and foremost, this study aims to create a local applicable way to track changing de- or reforestation patterns and further create an easily understandable way to qualitatively show the importance of reforestation.
#LIMITS
To quantitatively track possible changes in stream changes, which are contributed to land cover change one have to assess at least three years to evaluate the impact of seasonal climatic variability and the plant growth itself. So with the Implementation of the measuring infrastructure and data collection these analyses are prepared. 
#Here I do
In order to obtain a scaled-down, easy-to-understand assessment of the impact on the river's discharge that can be evaluated after a short period of time, I compare a healthy and a degraded catchment within the larger Yaque del Norte River basin. Geological, climatic, land cover and land use analyses are conducted to determine their influence on the overall river discharge. By developing a method for continuous and cost-effective measurement of discharge, a high temporal resolution can be achieved.
